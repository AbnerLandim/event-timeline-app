## 📝 About the Assignment

### ⏱ Time Spent

_It took me approximately **4 hours** to complete this assignment._

### 🌟 What I Like About My Implementation

- **Well-structured file organization**: The file structure ensures the code is easy to navigate and scalable for future enhancements.
- **Custom Hook for Data Management**: The custom hook (`useData`) simplifies data manipulation, making the code more modular and testable while enhancing DX (Developer Experience).

### 🔧 What I Would Improve

- **Design Enhancements**:  
  I would tweak the color scheme and refine the design to make it more visually appealing and aligned with modern UI principles.
- **Editable Dates**:  
  While dates are currently read-only, I’d like to enable date editing. This would require handling edge cases, so I chose to focus on editable event names due to time constraints.

### 🎨 Design Decisions

The design was inspired by **Apple’s calendar style**, with its clean, rounded borders, minimalist approach, and pastel color palette. The goal was to create a visually appealing and intuitive user interface.

### 🧪 Testing Strategy

Given more time, I would focus on:

1. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test scenarios for editing events and handling various data sets.
2. **Mocking Modular Components**:
   - The modularity of the implementation makes it easy to mock hooks, utility functions, and other parts of the codebase.
